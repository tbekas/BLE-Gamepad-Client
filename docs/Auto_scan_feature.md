# Auto-scan feature

The auto-scan feature (enabled by default) simplifies connecting BLE controllers by automatically managing the scanning
process in the background. It starts scanning whenever there are any initialized `BLEController` instances that are not
yet connected, and stops scanning once all instances are connected. Whenever a controller disconnects scanning is
started again.

# How it works

* When you call `BLEController::begin()` on a controller instance, the library increments the number of connection
  slots.
* Each time a controller connects to the board, it occupies one of those slots.
* Each time a controller disconnects, it releases its occupied slot.
* Scanning automatically starts when there are unoccupied connection slots (at least one controller is not
  connected). Scanning stops when all slots are occupied.

# Changing the default behavior

You can disable auto-scan by calling the static method `BLEGamepadClient::disableAutoScan()` before initializing
any `BLEController` instance with `begin()`. If you do so, you will need to manually manage scanningâ€”i.e., starting and
stopping it as needed.
