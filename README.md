# BLE-Gamepad-Client
Enables connection of BLE gamepads to ESP32 boards. Currently, only the Xbox Wireless Controller is supported.

# PlatformIO dependency
* Add the following line to the [lib_deps](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/sections/env/options/library/lib_deps.html) option of `[env:]` section of [platformio.ini](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/index.html) file.
```yaml
tbekas/BLE-Gamepad-Client@^0.1.0
```

# Example usage
* Add the following code to your project.
```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <BLEGamepadClient.h>

void onControlsUpdate(ControlsEvent& e) {
  Serial.printf("lx: %.2f, ly: %.2f\n", e.leftStickX, e.leftStickY);
}

Controller controller;

void setup(void) {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  controller.onControlsUpdate(onControlsUpdate);
  controller.begin();
}

void loop() {
  delay(1000);
}
```

* Using the [pio run](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/userguide/cmd_run.html#cmd-run) command, build the image.
```shell
pio run
```
* Upload the image to the connected board and start monitoring the serial port.
```shell
pio run -t upload -t monitor
```
* Call to `controller.begin()` will automatically start scanning until a controller is successfully connected. Connect the controller to the board using the controller's pairing button.
* After connecting a controller to the board, you should observe changing values of `lx` and `ly` in response to movement of the gamepad's left analog stick.

# Supported gamepads

## Xbox One Wireless Controller (model 1708)
Pairing instructions are the same as for model 1914. If controller is not pairing, you probably need to
